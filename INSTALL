Unix
====

Builds need qmake, that is official part of Qt.

qmake qwt.pro 
make


To build the designer plugin:

cd designer
qmake qwtplugin.pro
make
make install


If you like to build the examples:

cd examples
qmake examples.pro 
make

If you like to run the examples, don't forget to install the qwt libraries
or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the lib directory of your local build.

Qwt doesn't distribute binary unix packages. qwt.spec is a template
spec file for building rpm packages. Read the comments at the beginning 
of qwt.pro how to use it.

Win32
-----

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qwt.pro
nmake

cd designer
qmake qwtplugin.pro
nmake
nmake install

cd examples
qmake examples.pro
nmake

There is a msvc-qmake.bat batch file for Visual Studio users with Qt >= 3.0 to
generate makefiles or project files (.dsp for MSVC-6.0 or vcproj for MSVC.NET)
for Qwt, all examples and the designer plugin.
To generate makefiles, type: msvc-qmake
To generate project files, type: msvc-qmake vc

Win32/Qt 4.0.0

If you use the MinGW compiler from the MSYS shell do:

export MINGW_IN_SHELL=1;
qmake;
make
cd designer
qmake qwtplugin.pro
make
make install
cd examples
qmake 
make -i

Good luck !
